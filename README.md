Analogue Pocket Color Palettes

These are the Analogue Pocket color palettes that are accesible when you play a physical cart on the system. There was not an option to use these when playing on a Gameboy Core. I created these to use on the cores. These include the Mint, Blue, Green, and Purple color palettes available on the system.

To add these to your Analogue Pocket just grab the .gbp files that you want and add them to the folder, Assets/gb/common/Palettes on your Analogue Pocket's SD card.
You can updload the .pal file to a palette editing application such as https://simplepalettemaker.streamlit.app/ to edit the palettes to whatever you want!

To download a single file, click the file you want, then click the Raw download button on the right. To download the entire file, click the green Code button and download the zip file.

P.S. These palettes are not present in the https://github.com/davewongillies/openfpga-palettes/releases/tag/2025-01-27 files.
