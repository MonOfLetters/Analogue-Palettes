Analogue Pocket Color Palettes
These are the Analogue Pocket color palettes that are accesible when you play a physical cart on the system. There was not option to use these when playing on a Gameboy Core. I created these to use on the cores. These include the Mint, Blue, Green, and Purple color palettes available on the system.
